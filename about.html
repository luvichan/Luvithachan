        <h1>こんにちは～　</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone ૮ ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ ა. My name is.. Luvitha Shandary but all of my friends call me Luvitha or just Luvi. I am a new college student in Kyoto University or writen as 京都大学 and pronounced as Kyōto Daigaku, majoring Technology Science and Engineering. I'm 18 years old, and I'm Indonesian. I graduate from SMA N 1 Batangan on 2024 this year. I'm from batch 2 with my precious friends; Samuel Thijs Van Yjck, Kirara Sakamoto, Jiang Cheng, Kalila Rahayu Adibamawarna, Takeshi Itto, Masaki Kawamura, Haruhi Kashiwagi, and Raja Alghfari ( ・∀・). I like to drawing, listening to music and podcast, yapping, traveling alone, and imagining (I hope my delulu is become trululu :)). I motified by Albert Einstein from his famous mottos, "Imagination is more important than knowlwdge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution", I motivated by Einstein to pursue my dreams, even though they seem impossible and difficult, and despite being mocked by others. His belief that imagination is more important than knowledge inspires me to keep pushing forward, trusting that with creativity and determination, anything is possible, no matter the obstacles. As a new college student, i'm profience in basic coding and programming, as well as HTML and JavaScript, and i'm enchacing my skills to master CSS. In the field of scientifictechnology and engineering, i also focu on developing criticaland creative thingking abilities, and I excel in language skills. That's all my introduction for now; if you'd like to get to know me better, feel free to reach out my Instagram @sxcoziq hehe( ˘▽˘)っ. どもですね～　ありがとう...</p>
